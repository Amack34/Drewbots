## Live Kalshi Pricing (Today Feb 20)

### NYC High (NWS: 42°F)
| Bracket | YES Bid/Ask | Signal |
|---------|------------|--------|
| B41.5 (41-42°F) | 50/53 | ⚡ NWS says 42°F — this IS the bracket. Market at coin-flip. |
| B43.5 (43-44°F) | 5/8 | Longshot, 1°F above forecast. Maybe sell NO at 92-95¢? Thin margin. |
| B45.5 (45-46°F) | 1/3 | Dead money, skip. |
| T46 (>46°F) | 0/1 | No liquidity. |
| T39 (<39°F) | 3/5 | Longshot, rain keeping temps down but NWS says 42°F. |

### MIA High (NWS: 79°F — revised DOWN from 81°F!)
| Bracket | YES Bid/Ask | Vol | Signal |
|---------|------------|-----|--------|
| B82.5 (82-83°F) | 55/56 | 15.5K | ⚠️ MARKET SAYS 82-83°F BUT NWS SAYS 79°F! Potential edge! |
| B84.5 (84-85°F) | 33/34 | 8.5K | Market pricing ~33% for 84-85°F range. NWS says 79°F. |
| B80.5 (80-81°F) | 7/9 | 10.6K | Low price, but this is actually close to NWS forecast. |
| T85 (>85°F) | 2/3 | 4.7K | Correctly priced dead. |
| T78 (<78°F) | 0/1 | 3.4K | NWS says 79°F — this COULD hit. Market gives it 0-1¢!? |

### MIA Low (NWS: 70°F tonight → already at 66°F current!)
| Bracket | YES Bid/Ask | Vol | Signal |
|---------|------------|-----|--------|
| B64.5 (64-65°F) | 86/94 | 3.5K | Market thinks 64-65°F likely. Current temp IS 66°F. |
| B66.5 (66-67°F) | 0/1 | 7.4K | Already AT 66°F — this bracket should be in play but priced at 0. Settled? |
| B68.5 (68-69°F) | 0/1 | 7.7K | Settled or dead. NWS says low 70°F — this won't hit. |
| B62.5 (62-63°F) | 0/11 | 2.8K | Wide spread, little conviction. |

### NYC Low (NWS: 39°F tonight)
| Bracket | YES Bid/Ask | Signal |

| T37 (>37°F) | 0/1 | Settled/dead. NWS says 39°F — this should be YES! |

## ⚡ TOP 3-5 ACTIONABLE TRADES

### 1. 🔴 MIA HIGH B82.5 — SELL YES (Buy NO) ★★★★
- **Market:** YES 55/56¢ (market thinks 82-83°F most likely)
- **NWS Forecast:** 79°F (REVISED DOWN from 81°F)
- **Edge:** NWS says 79°F, market pricing 82-83°F as favorite. That's 3-4°F apart.
- **Action:** Buy NO at ~44-45¢. If NWS is right (79°F), NO wins.
- **Risk:** MIA has afternoon heat spikes. Current 66°F at 7am is normal. BUT 79°F vs 82°F is outside our 3°F safety margin.
- **Estimated edge:** 30-40%. High volume = liquid exit.
- **⚠️ CAUTION:** Verify this isn't a data lag issue. The B82.5 bracket at 55¢ with NWS at 79°F seems like a huge gap. Could be market makers pricing in MIA heat bias.

### 2. 🟡 MIA HIGH B84.5 — SELL YES (Buy NO) ★★★
- **Market:** YES 33/34¢
- **NWS:** 79°F. 84-85°F would need a 5-6°F overshoot.
- **Action:** Buy NO at ~66-67¢. Low risk if NWS is right.
- **Edge:** ~25-30%. Good risk/reward.
- **This is our bread and butter — selling overpriced longshots.**

### 3. 🟡 NYC HIGH B43.5 — SELL YES (Buy NO) ★★★
- **Market:** YES 5/8¢ (cheap longshot)
- **NWS:** 42°F. 43-44°F is 1-2°F above.
- **Problem:** Only 1°F margin. Rain could cause temp variability.
- **Edge:** ~10-15%. BELOW our 15% minimum. **SKIP unless spread improves.**

### 4. 🟢 MIA LOW B64.5 — Already priced at YES 86-94¢ ★★
- **Market:** YES 86/94¢
- **Current temp:** 66°F and NWS says low 70°F tonight.
- **If NWS is right (low 70°F):** The low won't reach 64-65°F. NO wins. Buy NO at 6-14¢.
- **Risk:** This might be for tonight's low which hasn't happened yet. NWS says 70°F low. BUT current temp already hit 66°F this morning — if settlement uses the 24h min including pre-dawn, this may already be decided.
- **Edge:** Unclear without knowing settlement rules. Needs investigation.

### 5. 🟡 MIA HIGH T78 (<78°F) ★★
- **Market:** YES 0/1¢ (market gives this basically 0%)
- **NWS:** 79°F. Only 1°F above threshold!
- **If clouds stick around or sea breeze comes early, MIA could land at 77-78°F.**
- **Risk:** Liquidity is 0. Can't actually get filled. Monitor.

## Non-Weather Scan
- **Iran situation:** No overnight escalation. Markets stable.
- **No breaking news** affecting Kalshi event markets.
- **Susquehanna hiring** = more institutional competition on Kalshi coming. Edge windows may shrink over months.

## ⚠️ Issues
1. **Balance API 401** — API token may have expired. Need to re-authenticate or refresh key.
2. **ATL/DC/BOS/PHI** — No open weather markets found via API. May need different series tickers or markets haven't opened for tomorrow yet.
3. **MIA pricing anomaly** — B82.5 at 55¢ when NWS says 79°F is suspicious. Triple-check before deploying capital (Lesson #17: if edge looks too good, sanity check inputs).

## Bottom Line
**MIA is the play today.** NWS revised high down to 79°F but market still pricing 82-83°F as favorite. If confirmed, B82.5 NO and B84.5 NO are strong sells. NYC markets are too tight — 42°F forecast with B41.5 at 50/50. Wait for tomorrow's markets to open for fresh pricing.

**Key change from 4am:** MIA forecast dropped from 81°F to 79°F. Market hasn't adjusted. This is the window.
