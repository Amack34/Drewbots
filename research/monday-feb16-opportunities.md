## 2. Kalshi Market Analysis

### NYC High (NWS: 40°F)
| Ticker | Bracket | Bid/Ask | Implied % |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| B39.5 | 39-40° | 47/48¢ | **47.5%** ← NWS target |
| B41.5 | 41-42° | 34/35¢ | 34.5% |
| B37.5 | 37-38° | 17/18¢ | 17.5% |
| B43.5 | 43-44° | 3/4¢ | 3.5% |
| T37 | ≤37° | 3/4¢ | 3.5% |
| T44 | ≥45° | 0/1¢ | 0.5% |

**Assessment:** Market and NWS aligned. 39-40° bracket correctly priced as mode. **No clear edge.**

### Miami High (NWS: 84°F)
| Ticker | Bracket | Bid/Ask | Implied % |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| B83.5 | 83-84° | 50/51¢ | **50.5%** ← NWS target |
| B81.5 | 81-82° | 26/27¢ | 26.5% |
| B85.5 | 85-86° | 21/22¢ | 21.5% |
| B79.5 | 79-80° | 4/5¢ | 4.5% |
| T79 | ≤79° | 2/3¢ | 2.5% |
| T86 | ≥87° | 0/1¢ | 0.5% |

**Assessment:** Market nailed it. 83-84° at 50.5% matches NWS 84°F. **No clear edge.**

### Philadelphia High (NWS: 40°F)
| Ticker | Bracket | Bid/Ask | Implied % |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| B41.5 | 41-42° | 44/45¢ | **44.5%** ← Market mode |
| B43.5 | 43-44° | 23/24¢ | 23.5% |
| B39.5 | 39-40° | 21/26¢ | 23.5% ← NWS target |
| B45.5 | 45-46° | 5/7¢ | 6% |
| T39 | ≤39° | 3/4¢ | 3.5% |
| T46 | ≥47° | 2/3¢ | 2.5% |

**Assessment:** Market expects 41-42° but NWS says 40°F. The 39-40° bracket has a wide spread (21-26¢) suggesting lower liquidity. **Mild edge** buying 39-40° YES at 26¢ if you trust NWS. But NWS says 40° which is right on the boundary.

### Boston High (NWS: 37°F)
| Ticker | Bracket | Bid/Ask | Implied % |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| B38.5 | 38-39° | 31/33¢ | 32% |
| B36.5 | 36-37° | 27/28¢ | **27.5%** ← NWS target |
| B40.5 | 40-41° | 22/25¢ | 23.5% |
| T36 | ≤36° | 10/11¢ | 10.5% |
| B42.5 | 42-43° | 4/5¢ | 4.5% |
| T43 | ≥43° | 3/4¢ | 3.5% |

**Assessment:** Market favors 38-39° slightly over NWS's 37°. Low volume (14-733 contracts). **Possible small edge** on 36-37° bracket at 28¢ if NWS accurate. Low liquidity = harder to execute.

### DC High (NWS: 48°F)
| Ticker | Bracket | Bid/Ask | Implied % |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| B47.5 | 47-48° | 30/33¢ | **31.5%** ← NWS target |
| B49.5 | 49-50° | 23/25¢ | 24% |
| B45.5 | 45-46° | 21/22¢ | 21.5% |
| T45 | ≤45° | 9/10¢ | 9.5% |
| B51.5 | 51-52° | 7/10¢ | 8.5% |
| T52 | ≥53° | 4/7¢ | 5.5% |

**Assessment:** Market and NWS aligned at 47-48° as mode. **No clear edge.**

### ⭐ Atlanta High (NWS: 66°F) - POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY
| Ticker | Bracket | Bid/Ask | Implied % |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| B69.5 | 69-70° | 31/32¢ | 31.5% ← Market mode |
| B67.5 | 67-68° | 30/31¢ | 30.5% |
| B65.5 | 65-66° | 19/20¢ | **19.5%** ← NWS target |
| B63.5 | 63-64° | 8/11¢ | 9.5% |
| T63 | ≤63° | 5/6¢ | 5.5% |
| T70 | ≥71° | 9/10¢ | 9.5% |

**Assessment:** Market expects 67-70°F but NWS says only 66°F. **The 65-66° bracket at 20¢ looks underpriced** if NWS is correct. Market-implied mean is ~68°F vs NWS 66°F = **2°F divergence**.

### Philadelphia Low (NWS: 29°F)
| Ticker | Bracket | Bid/Ask | Implied % |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| B33.5 | 33-34° | 26/27¢ | 26.5% |
| B31.5 | 31-32° | 23/32¢ | 27.5% ← wide spread! |
| B35.5 | 35-36° | 17/25¢ | 21% ← wide spread! |
| B29.5 | 29-30° | 9/13¢ | 11% |
| T36 | ≥37° | 4/6¢ | 5% |
| T29 | ≤29° | 2/3¢ | **2.5%** ← NWS target |

**Assessment:** ⭐ **BIGGEST DIVERGENCE.** NWS forecasts 29°F low, but market prices ≤29° at only 2.5% and 29-30° at 11%. Market-implied mode is 31-34°F. If NWS is right, the ≤29° YES at 3¢ or 29-30° YES at 13¢ are potentially very underpriced. However, wide bid-ask spreads suggest uncertainty.

## 3. Backtest Performance (⚠️ WARNING)

**Latest backtest run (bt_20260215_162108):**
- Total trades: 453
- Win rate: 0% (0 wins, 453 losses)
- Net P&L: -$43.35
- **⚠️ THIS RUN USED THE OLD BROKEN CONFIG** — 90% of trades (406/453) were 1¢ brackets which we've since disabled (min_entry_price now = 2¢)
- The earlier accuracy sweep backtest showed: ±3°F accuracy → 728 trades, 15.8% win rate, +663% return, Sharpe 4.56 at 5-10¢ brackets
- **The stored 0% run is NOT representative of the current strategy**

**Breakdown:**
| City | Type | Trades | Wins | Win% | P&L |
|------|------|--------|------|------|-----|
| NYC | high | 449 | 0 | 0% | -$29.52 |
| MIA | high | 4 | 0 | 0% | -$0.24 |

**⚠️ The 0% backtest was the OLD config (1¢ brackets). Current strategy (5-10¢ brackets) backtested at 15.8% win rate. Still, paper trading validation ongoing.**

## 4. Ranked Opportunities

### Tier 1: Actionable (Data-backed divergence)

**1. ATL High 65-66° YES @ 20¢**
- NWS forecast: 66°F (right in this bracket)
- Market pricing it at 19.5% but NWS puts it as the point forecast
- Potential edge: ~15-25% (NWS point forecasts hit the exact bracket ~35-40% of the time historically)
- Risk: $20 to make $80 per contract
- Concern: Sunny day, could overshoot to 67-68 easily
- **Verdict: MODERATE conviction. Consider 1-2 contracts.**

**2. PHL Low ≤29° YES @ 3¢ (speculative)**
- NWS forecast: 29°F (right at the cutoff)
- Market pricing at 2.5%, but NWS puts the low AT 29°
- If actual low is 28-29°, this pays 97¢
- Risk: $3 to make $97 per contract (32:1 potential)
- Concern: "29°F" NWS forecast could easily be 30-31°F in reality
- **Verdict: LOW conviction but asymmetric payoff. 1 contract max as a lottery ticket.**

**3. PHL Low 29-30° YES @ 13¢**
- NWS forecast: 29°F (this bracket captures 29-30°)
- Market pricing at 11%, feels low given NWS
- Risk: $13 to make $87 per contract
- **Verdict: MODERATE conviction. Better risk/reward than the ≤29 play.**

### Tier 2: Watchlist (Marginal edge)

**4. BOS High 36-37° YES @ 28¢** - NWS says 37°F, market has this as 2nd most likely. Slight edge if any.

**5. PHL High 39-40° YES @ 26¢** - NWS says 40°F, on the boundary. Wide spread.

### Tier 3: No Edge
- NYC High - market perfectly priced to NWS
- MIA High - market perfectly priced to NWS
- DC High - market aligned to NWS

## 5. Key Risks & Notes

1. **Presidents' Day** - Federal holiday. Lighter trading volume, wider spreads possible.
2. **Snow in NYC/PHL** - NWS mentions light snow chances. Cloud cover and precip can suppress highs.
3. **Fog in DC/ATL** - Morning fog could delay warming, potentially keeping ATL under market expectations (supports our ATL thesis).
4. **Backtest is 0% win rate** - Our automated strategy is broken. Manual analysis only.
5. **$20 account** - Position sizing must be conservative. Max 2-3 contracts total.

## 6. Recommended Action Plan

Given $20 bankroll and 0% backtest win rate:

| Trade | Contracts | Cost | Max Payout | Conviction |
|-------|-----------|------|------------|------------|
| ATL High 65-66° YES @ 20¢ | 2 | $0.40 | $1.60 | Medium |
| PHL Low 29-30° YES @ 13¢ | 2 | $0.26 | $1.74 | Medium |
| PHL Low ≤29° YES @ 3¢ | 1 | $0.03 | $0.97 | Low (lottery) |
| **Total risk** | | **$0.69** | **$4.31** | |

Conservative sizing: risk <$1 total given unproven manual strategy.
