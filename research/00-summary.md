## Top 3 Takeaways

### 1. Weather is the #1 opportunity
- Daily markets, free data (NWS API), NOAA settlement source
- 6 major cities with daily high/low temp markets
- Surrounding station strategy is sound — weather moves geographically
- Expected edge: 5-15% in the 6-hour window

### 2. Start small, compound fast
- With $20, trade 1-2 weather contracts/day
- Target 2-3% daily return through informational edge
- Daily resolution = fastest capital turnover on the platform
- Growth path: $20 → $50 (2 weeks) → $200 (2 months) → automation

### 3. The real edge is speed + data
- Most Kalshi traders check weather forecasts once and forget
- Real-time NWS observations update hourly
- Being systematic about checking data before trading = consistent edge
- Long-term: automate the entire pipeline
